# My Sofle Keyboard Build and Firmware

This is my Sofle build, featuring RGB lighting, wireless capability, ZMK firmware, knob, OLED support, and a custom case. It's a very budget-friendly build costing around â‚¬80 without keycaps and switches. This README provides an overview of the build process, helpful tips, and links to resources to help you complete your own Sofle build.

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my Sofle split keyboard build, featuring a fully customizable and 3D-printed case, wireless connectivity, and a personal twist on the firmware.

## Components & Purchase Links

Below are links to key components used in the build:

- [MiFuny SofleMX Kit3 Wireless](https://a.aliexpress.com/_EzIsfqt)
- [PS3 Batteries](https://amzn.eu/d/dv2OsZh)
- Switches: Kailh Deep Sea Silent Pro Box Linear Islet
- Keycaps: Not decided yet

## Custom Case Design

I will create a custom case for the Sofle keyboard, which will be available for download once complete. The files can be found in the **`/case`** directory of this repository.

- **Download the Case Files:**\* \*[Link to case files](/case)
- **Printing Tips:**\* Recommended material is ABS or PETG for strength and durability.\*
  - Consider using a 0.1 mm layer height to minimize visible layer lines for a smoother finish.

## Build Guide

For assembling the Sofle keyboard, I used the following detailed guide:

- [Sofle RGB MX Build Guide by PandaKB](https://pandakb.com/build-guides/sofle-rgb-mx-build-guide/?spm=a2g0s.imconversation.0.0.f3a23e5fCfvQAx)

Make sure to read through the guide thoroughly before starting your build.

## Tips and Tricks

Some helpful tips for assembling your Sofle split keyboard:

- **Preparation:**\* Ensure all components are properly seated before soldering.\*
- **Diode Orientation:**\* Double-check the orientation of diodes and LEDs.\*
- **Use Flux:**\* Flux makes soldering easier and cleaner.\*
- **Stabilizers:**\* Lubing your stabilizers will make the typing experience smoother.\*

## Firmware and Configuration

The firmware for my Sofle build is customized using ZMK, modified from PandaKB's config. The configuration files can be found in the \`\` folder.

- **Firmware:** [Link to firmware files](/firmware)

- **Flashing the Firmware:** Use the ZMK documentation to flash the firmware onto the controllers. (click on action)

- **User Setup Guide:** For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [ZMK User Setup Guide](https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup).
